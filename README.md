# Jupyter Notes 

These are just my personal python notes, as jupyter notebooks. Whenever I think "how do I do that in python again", or just "how do I approach this problem" I try play around a bit in Jupyter notebooks and see where I get. 

These notes simply serve as my personal reference point (and a way to sync notes across different machines), and aren't meant to ever be perfect or complete
